Step-1:Start.
Step-2:Input the points already given in the program.
Step-3:We sort all points according to x coordinates.
Step-4:Now, divide all points in two halves.
Step-5:Recursively find the smallest distances in both     
        subarrays.
Step-6:Take the minimum of two smallest distances. Let the   
        minimum be dmin. 
Step-7:Create an array strip[] that stores all points which         
        are at most d distance away from the middle line         
        dividing the two sets.
Step-8:Find the smallest distance in strip[]. 
Step-9:Return the minimum of dmin and the smallest distance 
       calculated in above Step-7 and return the respective 
   pair of points.
Step-10:Stop.
